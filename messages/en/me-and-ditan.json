    "p1": "I have mentioned an abandoned ancient garden in several of my novels—it is actually the Temple of Earth. Many years ago, before tourism had developed, the garden was so desolate and neglected that it resembled a wild field, rarely remembered by anyone.",
    "p2": "The Temple of Earth is very close to my home. Or rather, my home is very close to the Temple of Earth. In any case, I can only consider this fate. The Temple of Earth had been standing there for over four hundred years before I was born, and ever since my grandmother brought my father to Beijing when she was young, we had always lived not far from it—moving several times over fifty years, but always staying in its vicinity, and actually moving closer to it each time. I often feel there is something destined about this: as if this ancient garden had been waiting for me, enduring four hundred years of vicissitudes.",
    "p3": "It waited for me to be born, then waited for me to suddenly become crippled at the most arrogant age of my life. Over four hundred years, it had weathered away the ostentatious glazed tiles from the eaves of ancient halls, faded the flaunting vermillion on the walls, collapsed sections of high walls, and scattered the carved jade railings. The ancient cypresses around the altar grew ever more somber and deep, while wild grass and vines everywhere flourished with uninhibited ease. At that point, it seems, it was time for me to come. Fifteen years ago, one afternoon, I wheeled myself into the garden—it had prepared everything for a lost soul. The sun, following its eternal path, was growing larger and redder. In the quiet radiance that filled the garden, one could more easily perceive time and see one's own shadow.",
    "p4": "Since that afternoon when I accidentally entered this garden, I have never stayed away from it for long. I understood its intention at once. As I wrote in one of my novels: \"In a densely populated city, to have such a tranquil retreat seems like heaven's painstaking arrangement.\"",
    "p5": "In the first few years after my legs became disabled, I couldn't find work, couldn't find a way forward—suddenly I could find almost nothing. So I would always wheel myself there, simply because it was another world where I could escape from this one.",
    "quote1": "With nowhere else to go, I would spend all day in this garden. Like going to work, when others went to their jobs, I would wheel myself here. The garden wall cast a strip of cool shade in the golden air; I would wheel into it, recline the chair, sit or lie down, read or think, snap off a twig to swat at those small insects who, like me, didn't understand why they had come into this world.",
    "p6": "A bee would hover steadily in mid-air like a tiny cloud; an ant would shake its head and stroke its antennae, then suddenly, as if having figured something out, turn and hurry away; a ladybug, tired of crawling, would pause to pray, then spread its wings and float up into the air; on the tree trunk, a cicada shell remained, lonely as an empty room; dewdrops would roll on grass blades, gather, bend the blade down, then crash to the ground, shattering into ten thousand rays of golden light. The whole garden was alive with the sounds of plants competing to grow, rustling ceaselessly. These are all true records—the garden was desolate but not decayed.",
    "p7": "Except for a few halls I couldn't enter, except for the altar I couldn't climb and could only gaze at from various angles, I had been under every tree in the Temple of Earth; nearly every square meter of its grass bore the prints of my wheels. Whatever the season, whatever the weather, whatever the time, I had been in this garden. Sometimes I would stay just a while before going home; sometimes I would stay until moonlight covered the ground. I can't remember which corners it was, but I would spend hours at a stretch concentrating on thoughts of death, and with the same patience and manner, I would think about why I was born. After thinking like this for years, I finally understood:",
    "highlight1": "Once a person is born, this is no longer a debatable question, but simply a fact handed to them by heaven; and when heaven hands us this fact, it has already guaranteed its outcome. Therefore, death is not something to rush toward—death is a festival that will inevitably arrive.",
    "p8": "After thinking this through, I felt much more at peace, and everything before me no longer seemed so frightening. It's like when you're staying up late studying for exams, and suddenly you remember there's a long vacation waiting for you ahead—wouldn't you feel a bit more relaxed? And grateful for such an arrangement?",
    "p9": "What remains is the question of how to live. But this is not something that can be fully understood in a single moment, not something that can be solved once and for all. Perhaps you have to think about it for as long as you live, like a demon or lover that accompanies you through life. So, fifteen years on, I still have to go to that ancient garden, to sit silently under its old trees or by its wild grass or crumbling walls, to think blankly, to push aside the noise in my ears and sort out my tangled thoughts, to peer into my own soul. Over these fifteen years, the physical form of this ancient garden has been arbitrarily altered by people who don't understand it, but fortunately, there are some things that no one can change.",

    "ending": "Scent is the hardest thing to describe—it cannot be written, only smelled. You must be there to smell it to understand. Scent is even difficult to remember; only when you smell it again can you recall all its emotions and meanings. That is why I often have to go to that garden."
