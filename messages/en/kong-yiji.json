    "intro": "The Xianheng Tavern in Luzhen was a place where one could witness all the warmth and coldness of human nature.",
    "part1": {
      "p1": "The layout of taverns in Luzhen was different from elsewhere. Facing the street was a large L-shaped counter with hot water kept ready to warm wine at any time. Workers who had finished their shifts would spend four copper coins for a bowl of wine and drink standing by the counter; only by spending over a dozen coins could one buy a meat dish.",
      "p2": "Short-coated workers drank standing, long-gowned scholars drank seated. This was the unwritten rule in Luzhen's taverns.",
      "p3": "I started working at the Xianheng Tavern when I was twelve. The shopkeeper had a fierce face, and the customers were never pleasant, leaving no room for liveliness. Only when Kong Yiji came could one have a few laughs."
    },
    "part2": {
      "p1": "Kong Yiji was the only long-gowned customer who drank his wine standing. He was tall, with a pale face often marked with scars between the wrinkles, and an unkempt graying beard. Though he wore a long gown, it was filthy and tattered.",
      "p2": "When he spoke, he was always full of classical phrases that were half-understood. Because his surname was Kong, people took his nickname from the practice copybook phrase \"Shang Da Ren Kong Yi Ji.\""
    },
    "part3": {
      "p1": "Whenever Kong Yiji arrived, everyone drinking would watch him and laugh. Someone would deliberately shout: \"You must have stolen something again!\"",
      "p2": "Kong Yiji's face would flush red, the veins on his forehead bulging, as he argued: \"Taking books cannot be considered stealing... Taking books! Can a scholar's affairs be called stealing?\" Then came incomprehensible phrases that made everyone roar with laughter. Inside and outside the tavern was filled with a cheerful atmosphere."
    },
    "part4": {
      "p1": "Kong Yiji knew he couldn't chat with them, so he would only talk to children. Once he asked me: \"Have you studied? How do you write the 'hui' in fennel beans?\""
    },
    "transition": "Kong Yiji brought such merriment, but without him, life went on just the same.",
    "part5": {
      "p1": "One day, the shopkeeper was slowly settling accounts when he suddenly said: \"Kong Yiji hasn't come for a long time. He still owes nineteen coins!\" A drinker said: \"How could he come? His legs were broken.\"",
      "p2": "After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the autumn wind grew colder day by day. One afternoon, suddenly came a voice: \"Warm a bowl of wine.\" Though the voice was very low, it sounded familiar. Standing up to look outside, there was Kong Yiji sitting below the counter against the threshold."
    },
    "ending": {
      "p1": "After that, Kong Yiji was not seen again for a long time. At year's end, the shopkeeper took down the chalk board and said: \"Kong Yiji still owes nineteen coins!\" At the Dragon Boat Festival the next year, he said it again. By Mid-Autumn he said nothing, and by year's end he was still not seen.",
      "final": "To this day I have never seen him again — Kong Yiji must indeed be dead."
