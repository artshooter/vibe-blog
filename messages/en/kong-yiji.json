      "p1": "The tavern layout in Luzhen was different from elsewhere. A counter shaped like a large 'L' faced the street, with hot water ready for warming wine. Manual laborers, having finished their shifts, would often spend four copper coins for a bowl of wine — this was twenty some years ago, now it's ten coins a bowl — and drink it standing by the counter to rest. If they could spend another coin, they might buy a dish of salted bamboo shoots or fennel beans to go with their wine. For a dozen or so coins, one could get a meat dish. However, most customers were 'short-coated' laborers who could not afford such luxury. Only those in long gowns would walk into the room adjoining the tavern and sit down to order their wine and food at leisure.",
      "p2": "From the age of twelve, I began working as a waiter at the Xianheng Tavern at the edge of town. The manager said I looked too dull to serve the long-gowned patrons, so I was assigned to work outside. The short-coated customers were easier to talk to, but many were fussy and talkative. They would insist on seeing the wine ladled from the jar, checking for water in the pot, and watching it be placed in the hot water. Under such strict supervision, diluting the wine was difficult. After a few days, the manager decided I was unfit for this task. Fortunately, the influence of my recommender was great, so I couldn't be dismissed and was reassigned to the bored duty of warming wine.",
      "p3": "From then on, I stood all day inside the counter, tending to my duties. Though I did nothing wrong, I felt the work was monotonous and dull. The manager was fierce-faced, and the customers never had a kind word, making it impossible to feel lively. Only when Kong Yiji arrived could there be some laughter, which is why I remember him to this day."

    "part2": {
      "p1": "Kong Yiji was the only person who drank standing while wearing a long gown. He was tall, with a pale face often marked by scars in the wrinkles, and an unkempt, graying beard. Though he wore a long gown, it was filthy and tattered, appearing as if it hadn't been patched or washed in over ten years. He spoke in a way that was full of classical particles, making him difficult to understand. Because his surname was Kong, people gave him the nickname 'Kong Yiji' from the phrase 'Shang Da Ren Kong Yi Ji' in children's copybooks. Whenever Kong Yiji arrived, everyone in the tavern would laugh and shout, 'Kong Yiji, you've got a new scar on your face!' He wouldn't answer but would say to the counter, 'Warm two bowls of wine and a dish of fennel beans,' laying out nine large coins. They would shout again, 'You must have stolen something again!' Kong Yiji would widen his eyes and say, 'How can you defile a man's character without proof...' 'What character? I saw you with my own eyes the day before yesterday, being hung up and beaten for stealing books from the He family.' Kong Yiji would flush, the veins on his forehead bulging, arguing, 'Taking books can't be called stealing... Taking books! For a scholar, can it be considered stealing?' This was followed by incomprehensible talk about 'Virtuous scholars remain steadfast even in poverty' and classical particles, making everyone roar with laughter. The whole tavern was filled with a cheerful atmosphere."

    "part3": {
      "p1": "I heard people gossiping that Kong Yiji had once studied but had failed to pass the official examinations and had no way of making a living. Thus, he grew poorer until he was on the verge of begging. Luckily, he had excellent handwriting and could make a living by copying books for people. Unfortunately, he also had a bad habit of being fond of drink and lazy. After sitting for just a few days, he would disappear along with the books, paper, and ink stones. After this happened several times, no one would hire him to copy books anymore. With no other choice, he would occasionally resort to petty theft. But in our tavern, his conduct was better than most: he never defaulted on his debts. Though he might occasionally be short on cash and his name would be written on the blackboard, he always paid in full within a month, and his name would be wiped clean.",
      "p2": "After Kong Yiji had finished half a bowl of wine and his flushed face had returned to its normal color, someone would ask, 'Kong Yiji, can you really read?' Kong Yiji would look at the questioner with a disdainful expression. They would continue, 'How is it you didn't even manage to become a Xiucai?' Kong Yiji would immediately look dejected and uneasy, his face turning a shade of gray, muttering incomprehensible classical phrases. At this, everyone would laugh again, and the tavern was once more filled with a cheerful atmosphere."

    "part4": {
      "p1": "At such times, I could join in the laughter without the manager scolding me. In fact, the manager himself would often ask such questions to make people laugh. Kong Yiji, knowing he could not converse with them, would turn to talk to the children. Once he said to me, 'Have you studied?' I nodded slightly. He said, 'If you have studied, let me test you. How do you write the \"hui\" in fennel beans?' Thinking a beggar like him was unworthy of testing me, I turned away and ignored him. After waiting a long while, he said very earnestly, 'Can't write it? Let me teach you. Remember it! These characters should be remembered. You'll need them for keeping accounts when you become a manager.' I thought to myself that I was a long way from being a manager, and besides, our manager never put fennel beans on the account. Feeling both amused and annoyed, I replied lazily, 'Who needs your teaching? Isn't it just the character \"hui\" with the grass radical on top?' Kong Yiji looked extremely pleased and tapped the counter with his long fingernails, nodding, 'Yes, yes! ... There are four ways to write the character \"hui\". Do you know them?' Becoming more impatient, I pouted and walked away. Kong Yiji had just dipped his finger in wine and was ready to write on the counter, but seeing my lack of interest, he sighed with a look of great regret."

      "p1": "Sometimes, the neighborhood children would hear the laughter and gather around Kong Yiji. He would give them fennel beans, one for each child. After eating the beans, the children would stay and stare at the dish. Kong Yiji would become anxious, covering the dish with his hand and bending over to say, 'Not many left. I already don't have many left.' Standing up to look at the beans again, he would shake his head and say, 'Not many at all! Many indeed? Not many.' Then the crowd of children would disperse amid laughter."

    "transition": "Kong Yiji brought such merriment, but without him, life went on just the same.",
    "part6": {
      "p1": "One day, about two or three days before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the manager was slowly settling his accounts. Taking down the blackboard, he suddenly said, 'Kong Yiji hasn't come for a long time. He still owes nineteen coins!' Only then did I realize that he indeed hadn't come for a while. A drinker said, 'How could he come? His legs were broken.' The manager said, 'Oh!' 'He still kept stealing. This time, he must have been out of his mind to steal from the house of Patron Ding. Can you steal from his house?' 'What happened then?' 'What happened? First a written confession, then a beating. They beat him for most of the night, and then they broke his legs.' 'And then?' 'And then his legs were broken.' 'What happened after they were broken?' 'Who knows? Maybe he's dead.' The manager asked no more and went back to his accounts."

    "part7": {
      "p1": "After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the autumn wind grew colder day by day. As early winter approached, I had to wear a cotton-padded jacket even sitting by the fire. One afternoon, when there were no customers, I was sitting with my eyes closed. Suddenly I heard a voice, 'Warm a bowl of wine.' The voice was very low but sounded very familiar. When I looked, there was no one. Standing up and looking out, I saw Kong Yiji sitting against the threshold below the counter. His face was black and thin, and he was in a wretched state. He wore a tattered padded jacket and was sitting cross-legged on a piece of matting suspended from his shoulders by a straw rope. Seeing me, he said again, 'Warm a bowl of wine.' The manager poked his head out and said, 'Is that Kong Yiji? You still owe nineteen coins!' Kong Yiji replied dejectedly, 'I'll pay it back next time. This time it's cash, and I want good wine.' The manager, as usual, joked, 'Kong Yiji, you've been stealing again!' But this time he didn't argue much, only saying, 'Don't make fun of me!' 'Make fun? If you didn't steal, how did you break your legs?' Kong Yiji whispered, 'Fell and broke, fell... fell...' His eyes seemed to plead with the manager not to mention it again. A few people had gathered by then, and they all laughed with the manager. I warmed the wine and placed it on the threshold. He fished four large coins from his tattered pocket and placed them in my hand. Seeing his hands were covered in mud, I realized he had come here using his hands. A while later, having finished his wine, he slowly walked away on his hands amidst the laughter of others."

      "p1": "Since then, Kong Yiji was never seen again. At year's end, the manager took down the blackboard and said, 'Kong Yiji still owes nineteen coins!' At the Dragon Boat Festival the following year, he said the same. By Mid-Autumn he said nothing, and at year's end he was still not seen.",
      "final": "To this day I have never seen him again — Kong Yiji must indeed be dead."
