                "title": "1. Building Observability",
                "p1": "Code often feels like a \"black box\" to non-professionals. Professional programmers observe logic by logging or printing information to the console. Even if you don't code, you need this \"observational intent.\" This observability helps you understand the current status of the system.",
                "example": "For example, when building a learning tool based on YouTube videos, you need to display the retrieved subtitles and audio as intermediate steps to determine if a specific step failed."

                "title": "2. Ability to Abstract Complex Problems",
                "p1": "Computer technology is inherently complex; a simple app may have many deep technical foundations. We need abstraction to simplify the structure for better understanding.",
                "p2": "Taking web development as an example, you should be able to abstract its basic structure: a web application consists of a client-side and a server-side, connected via a network. Further abstracting the server-side: it includes API exposure, internal service logic, and persistent data.",
                "example": "Using a YouTube-based learning tool as an example, internal logic can be decomposed into: fetching video data, parsing data, organizing data, and displaying it. This abstraction ability helps you simplify problems, clarify your position, and reduce cognitive load."

                "title": "3. Debugging and Troubleshooting Mindset",

                "example": "For example, in app development, if your app isn't running normally, you might need to determine if the issue is with the server or the client. If all versions of the app fail, it's likely a server issue. If only one version fails while others are normal, it might be that specific client version.",

            "p2": "In the process of engineering construction, you will constantly face choices. AI can give you options, but it cannot judge whether the goals, stages, and trade-offs are reasonable for you. You must clearly anticipate: what will be the cost of doing this, and what will be gained. All of this is based on your precise control of current position and goals. Of course, if you cannot clearly anticipate, acknowledge your ambiguity and plan to try it out, but you must know \"the project is currently in an experimental state.\""

                        "p1": "For instance, when we browse Twitter, the process goes: phone asks server for content -> server gets content from database -> server organizes it and returns it to the phone.",
                        "p2": "In this process, what role does the database play? You can think of the database as a massive repository, containing many 'Excel' sheets. these tables store everyone's tweets.",
                        "p3": "When you refresh Twitter, the server should return the latest tweets to you. This is like the server sending a request to the database: 'Hey, I want the latest news, please return the latest tweets.' The database receives the request and returns those stored latest tweets to the server.",
                        "p4": "This might give you a basic understanding of the database concept."

                "p2": "And there's a great thing now: we no longer need to set uniform goals like traditional courses. We can let AI set different open-ended goals based on your interests: if you want to make a game, let AI help you start making a game; if you want to make a website, then go make a website."
