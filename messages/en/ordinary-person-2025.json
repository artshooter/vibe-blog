    "p1": "In June, I quit my job without having another one lined up.",
    "p2": "After leaving work, I realized I hadn't been doing well in my career. People my age were becoming managers or senior specialists, while I seemed stuck in place. I started blaming my career stagnation on not choosing the right industry. With AI's help, I began exploring and learning, building many things. First, a Chinese astrology website for foreigners, featuring explanations they could understand. I launched a simple demo, but thought the product wasn't good enough. Without promotion, no one used it, so I stopped optimizing and gave up. Then I tried quantitative trading, backtesting basic strategies with historical data, only to find it wasn't that simple. Shelved. Tried making a small game, got stuck on 3D modeling resources. Gave up. Then I started reading books and occasionally fixing bugs for open source projects.",
    "highlight1": "I couldn't find anything to do, yet I couldn't stand doing nothing",
    "p3": "In September, I attended my high school friend's wedding. After graduating from a top university, he went to work as a technician at a traditional state-owned enterprise in a third-tier city. At first, they even had to work night shifts every week. When we first graduated, I thought it was a waste for a top university graduate to work factory night shifts. My friend didn't think much of it and kept working there. I knew he got promoted somewhere along the way, but didn't know the details. At his wedding, I learned he had already reached section chief level. At the reception, I watched him toast the leaders at the next table. The table was mostly middle-aged people, with a thin, short man with thick eyebrows sitting at the head — obviously shrewd. The old man beckoned my friend to lean in close and whispered something, while my friend's wife stood nearby holding a wine glass, chatting with other middle-aged people. They were too far away for me to hear. I felt my friend had integrated into their circle. He had found his place.",
    "p4": "After the wedding, I became more obsessed. The impact from my section-chief friend was huge. Beyond feeling he was doing better than me, that steady development was more substantial than my job-hopping. More importantly, I felt he had found his place — or rather, he had achieved inner peace. While I still didn't know what I wanted.",
    "highlight2": "I felt my constant searching was meaningless. His steady work had actually constructed real meaning for him.",
    "p5": "I started looking for jobs sporadically. After much thought, I decided AI was the trend, so I should look for AI-related work first, and only return to my original field if that didn't work out. So I looked into what AI jobs required. Many were Agent-related. I built an Agent to match my resume with job descriptions on recruitment platforms. While applying, I always felt unprepared and didn't want to interview. Thinking I had planned to rest for six months anyway, I decided to prepare more. So I stopped interviewing.",
    "p6": "Later I started working on AI Agent projects. I wanted to build an AI chess game that would automatically match the player's skill level — chess is only fun when both sides are evenly matched. But after some exploration, I found I couldn't do it. There were some related explorations online, predicting moves based on massive human game databases. Too hard, I gave up. Then I made an AI Werewolf game where AI and humans play together. It worked okay, had a demo, but I thought it was mediocre so I didn't promote it. Without users, there was no motivation to improve.",
    "highlight3": "In early December, I looked back. What was I doing? Why was I like a monkey picking corn — picking one up, throwing it away?",
    "p7": "Wait, I think I'm onto something...",
    "p8": "I remembered a scene. When I was young, if I didn't do well on a test, teachers would say: \"You're actually quite smart, just a bit careless, not trying hard enough.\" Honestly, every time I heard this, I felt an emotion happier than comfort — almost a twisted pride. I seemed to be saying to imaginary classmates in my head, \"See? I was just careless. But I'm smart. If I just pay more attention, I'd definitely be first in the grade. You all only do well because you try hard — anyone can try hard. But only I am smart. Once I actually try, you'll all fall behind.\"",
    "quote1": "The 'possibility' of being smart is freedom. Real effort means locking your future in a narrow corridor. Once you truly persist in effort, you must accept a crueler constraint: you'll be bound to one path for a long time.",
    "p9": "From elementary school to high school, I heard \"smart, just didn't try\" many times. But I seem to have never truly tried.",
    "p10": "Now it's the same situation. I discovered I'm afraid of effort, afraid of real feedback.",
    "insight1": "I'm afraid of losing the imaginary space where 'I could succeed if I just tried'",
    "insight2": "I'm afraid that after facing others' feedback, I'll realize — I'm actually just an ordinary person?",
    "p11": "I sighed and thought: be brave. I'm an ordinary person.",
    "p12": "I don't need to pursue grand meaning from the start. Thinking too much, doing too little, trapped by perfectionism and indecision. So I started doing small things: writing articles, making videos to share, building small projects. Output first, then adjust. Thinking alone can't find direction.",
    "p13": "As for work, I now understand it this way: life has two layers. One is 'support': find a way to make money, ensure survival. The other is 'exploration': invest in things you're willing to accumulate and try long-term. Work only needs to satisfy the first layer. Of course, if both layers can be satisfied at once, that's tremendous luck.",
    "ending1": "These thoughts may not be mature, but they truly happened this year.",
    "ending2": "If you can relate, this writing is honored~"
